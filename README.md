# 3D-Geometry-Calculator

Creating a 3D Geometry Calculator that will calculate the volume and surface respectively based on user’s selection.

The following are the requirements for the 3D Geometry Calculator.

A. First user must enter a username and a password. If the username and password are not 
matched, then ask the user to reenter the username and password again. Only three 
attempts are allowed, otherwise terminate the program.

B. If the username and the password are matched, then the user may proceed to use the 
calculator.

C. The calculator should display the lists of all 3D Geometry as in shown in Table 1. 

D. The user should select the desired 3D Geometry based on the Code. If the user enters a 
wrong input, the program should ask the user to enter again until it gets a valid input.

E. Then the user should choose one of the two options (1 for calculate volume, 2 for 
calculate surface area). If the user enters a wrong input, the program should ask the user 
to enter again until it gets a valid input.

F. The program will display the volume, or the surface area based on the user’s selections.

G. After the above processes are completed, the program will ask the user whether to 
continue the process or to terminate the program
